Axios automatically converts the response into JSON format unlike fetch.

Axios automatically catches the errors when they are not in the 200 range of HTTP responses. In this case if we get errors, they will be logged out to the console. (Script.jsx ln 41). In the if statement, we get a response but not in the 200 range. In the else statement, we do not get a response at all.
